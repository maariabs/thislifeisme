...are my three favorite things, and what this website mainly focuses on. 
        <br>
        <br>
I am originally from Denmark but I moved to New York in November 2016, which was a pretty big decision, but also a decision I am very happy that I made. I have always loved to travel and experience new places. I've been abroad several times during my education, which ranged between 3-7 months each time. Therefore I was really excited to actually move to New York without any end date. 
While I am living in New York I try to travel as often as possible, and I even made an agreement with a colleague that we will try to visit every state of the United States. I believe I am currently at 18% of the states, so I still have a long way to go, but I guess I have my whole life to do it, right? 
        <br>
        <br>
I have always loved food and trying new restaurants, it is also one of my favorite things about traveling. Moving to New York I am overwhelmed with all the good food and restaurants over here. I have made a Yelp list with the restaurants I still have to try. I will add a restaurant whenever I walk by one and feel like that is a place I'll have to try sometime, or when I see a food blogger post a delicious picture of food, or just when I get a good recommendation from someone. I believe my Yelp list currently has 40 restaurants I still have to try, and I feel like whenever I get one down, I will add two more.

        <br>
        <br>
Another thing I really enjoy is to write. I think a lot, and I think about everything, the world, people, myself. I wonder about all kinds of different things and I want to understand. Since I was little it have been helpful for me to get some of my thoughts down in writing, and therefore I write.
